        <h1 class="text">Photography in black & white</h1>

        <p class="text"><br>Photography in black and white or grayscale are a
          popular expression for photo art. Its subtle expression make you pay
          more attention to the details and the feeling of the picture are a bit
          more calming and soothing than photos in color. To get the asolutely
          best photograph using grayscale Photoshop or Lightroom is a must.
          Where you can alter contrast, curves and other attributes to really
          make the photograph stand out.<br><br>Black and white photos can be a
          bit tricky to print since most printers use all their colors to print
          black and white. They actually mix colors together to get different
          shades of grey and black. For a photograpgher or someone who is really
          interested in art this can be a real hassle. You often see that the
          photo tends to have a slightly red, purple, green or blue shade. To
          get a real black and white photo your therefor need to use a printer
          that only uses the Black color, whether its ink or laser your print
          with. <br><br> Most photographers use large format printers, even though
          these are professional printers they rarely let you print with only
          black and grey inks. One slution is to get a RIP, a special software
          that forces the printer to only use choosen colors. This is the
          absolutely best way to get true black and white photos. Even though
          the software can be a bit expensive, your only pay for it once and will
          save a lot of money by not needing to adjust the colors all the time
          to get the perfetct photo.</p>

        <h1 class="text">Nature photos in winter</h1>

        <p class="text">Winter can be a tricky time to take photos since the
          light isn't that good and you often need to get up early to catch the
          best light. Another problem can be that nature is mostly greyish all
          the flowers are gone, the trees have lost their leaves and the gras
          isn't green anymore. One solution can be to photographg other parts
          of nature, that you don't really notice during summer, or parts of
          nature that really comes alive during winter. <br><br>Some of those
          areas is everything surrounding water. In winter, a frozen lake or a
          snowy mountain can be beautiful to photograph, even though they might
          not look that appealing during summer. I really recommend you to visit
          nature in different seasong so that you get a feel of which motives
          works best during which season, since they are rarely the same ones.<br><br>
          It's also a good idea to check the weather report closely during winter
          since most landscapes are much prettier when it has been snowing.
          Untouched snow is one of the most beautiful motives you can find
          accorindg to me! Another important part of taking photos during winter
          is to dress for the part. It can be challeging to be outside for
          several hours when it's cold and windy. And we all know that capturing
          that perfect photo can take time. So dress wisely and pay attention to the
          weather at your location. <br><br> I really hope you got some good
          tips from this post, and hopefully it will help you come closer to
          those beautiful winter photos.</p>

        <p class="text"><br>One of the absolutely best tools when it comes to
          editing is Photoshop. With Photoshop you can do pretty much everything
          and in enhances your photos big time! For everyont out there that loves
          eiditing programs as much as I do, I also recommend taking a closer
          look at Lightroom. It's a great program, and the possibility to edit
          photos on the go in your phone are so usefull. For those of you that
          hasn't spent so much time woring with different kind of eiditing software
          I recommend that you start with Lightroom first, since it's a bit easier
          for a new beginner.<br><br>When you work with black and white photos
          editing programs are so usefull and quite necessary. To be able to
          adjust contrast, hue, curves and levels makes the image pop. A great
          way to learn these programs is just to play around with them. Import
          your favorite photo and start to try out different tools. <br><br>
          There are a bunch of courses online where you can find good information
          if you want to learn Photoshop or Lightroom. Thats perfect for those
          of us who don't want to pay large amounts of money for paid courses.
          Hopefully you find as much use of editing software as I do, and if you
          have any questions, feel free to contact me. I'm happy to help!</p>
